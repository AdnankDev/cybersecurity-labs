##  Objectives
- Define the **audit scope** (devices, networks, and internal systems)  
- Conduct a **risk assessment** to identify high-risk areas  
- Evaluate controls using **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** categories  
- Review compliance with **PCI DSS**, **GDPR**, and **SOC** standards  
- Provide **actionable recommendations** to enhance security
